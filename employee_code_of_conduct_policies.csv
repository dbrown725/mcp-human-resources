Business Dress Code Policy,https://resources.workable.com/dress-code-company-policy,"""## **Policy brief & purpose** Our **dress code company policy** outlines how we expect our employees to dress at work. Employees should note that their appearance matters when representing our company in front of clients, visitors or other parties. An employee’s appearance can create a positive or negative impression that reflects on our company and culture. ## **Scope** This policy applies to all our employees. ## **Policy elements** These dress code rules always apply: - All employees must be clean and well-groomed. Grooming styles dictated by religion and ethnicity aren’t restricted. - All clothes must be work-appropriate. Clothes that are typical in workouts and outdoor activities aren’t allowed. - All clothes must project professionalism. Clothes that are too revealing or inappropriate aren’t allowed. - All clothes must be clean and in good shape. Discernible rips, tears or holes aren’t allowed. - Employees must avoid clothes with stamps that are offensive or inappropriate. ### **What is Business Dress Code?** Our company’s official dress code is \[ _Business/ Business Casual/ Smart Casual/ Casual._ \] We may change our dress code in special cases. For example, we may require employees to wear semi-formal attire for an event. Then, both male and female employees should wear suits, ties, white shirts and appropriate shoes. Our company may also introduce \[_dress-down Friday_\] when employees can wear more casual clothing like jeans, simple blouses and boots. This won’t apply if employees are meeting with clients, partners and other external parties. An employee’s position may inform their dress code. If employees frequently meet with clients or prospects, they should conform to a business dress code. ## **Disciplinary Consequences** When an employee disregards our dress code, their supervisor should reprimand them. The employee should start respecting our dress code immediately. In some cases, supervisors may ask employees to returning home to change. Employees may face more severe consequences up to and [including termination](https://resources.workable.com/dress-code-company-policy), if: - Their appearance causes irreparable damage, like loss of a major client. - They repeatedly violate our dress code."""
Cyber Security Policy,https://resources.workable.com/cyber-security-policy,"""## **Policy brief & purpose** Our company cyber security policy outlines our guidelines and provisions for preserving the [security of our data](https://resources.workable.com/data-protection-company-policy) and technology infrastructure. The more we rely on technology to collect, store and manage information, the more vulnerable we become to severe security breaches. Human errors, hacker attacks and system malfunctions could cause great financial damage and may jeopardize our company’s reputation. For this reason, we have implemented a number of security measures. We have also prepared instructions that may help mitigate security risks. We have outlined both provisions in this policy. ## **Scope** This policy applies to all our employees, contractors, volunteers and anyone who has permanent or temporary access to our systems and hardware. ## **Policy elements** ### **Confidential data** [Confidential data](https://resources.workable.com/confidentiality-company-policy) is secret and valuable. Common examples are: - Unpublished financial information - Data of customers/partners/vendors - Patents, formulas or new technologies - Customer lists (existing and prospective) All employees are obliged to protect this data. In this policy, we will give our employees instructions on how to avoid security breaches. ### **Protect personal and company devices** When employees use their [digital devices](https://resources.workable.com/cell-phone-company-policy) to access company emails or accounts, they introduce security risk to our data. We advise our employees to keep both their personal and company-issued computer, tablet and cell phone secure. They can do this if they: - Keep all devices password protected. - Choose and upgrade a complete antivirus software. - Ensure they do not leave their devices exposed or unattended. - Install security updates of browsers and systems monthly or as soon as updates are available. - Log into company accounts and systems through secure and private networks only. We also advise our employees to avoid accessing internal systems and accounts from other people’s devices or lending their own devices to others. When new hires receive company-issued equipment they will receive instructions for: - \[_Disk encryption setup_\] - \[_Password management tool setup_\] - \[_Installation of antivirus/ anti-malware software_\] They should follow instructions to protect their devices and refer to our \[_Security Specialists/ Network Engineers_\] if they have any questions. ### **Keep emails safe** [Emails](https://resources.workable.com/email-usage-policy-template) often host scams and malicious software (e.g. worms.) To avoid virus infection or data theft, we instruct employees to: - Avoid opening attachments and clicking on links when the content is not adequately explained (e.g. “watch this video, it’s amazing.”) - Be suspicious of clickbait titles (e.g. offering prizes, advice.) - Check email and names of people they received a message from to ensure they are legitimate. - Look for inconsistencies or give-aways (e.g. grammar mistakes, capital letters, excessive number of exclamation marks.) If an employee isn’t sure that an email they received is safe, they can refer to our \[_IT Specialist_.\] ### **Manage passwords properly** Password leaks are dangerous since they can compromise our entire infrastructure. Not only should passwords be secure so they won’t be easily hacked, but they should also remain secret. For this reason, we advice our employees to: - Choose passwords with at least eight characters (including capital and lower-case letters, numbers and symbols) and avoid information that can be easily guessed (e.g. birthdays.) - Remember passwords instead of writing them down. If employees need to write their passwords, they are obliged to keep the paper or digital document confidential and destroy it when their work is done. - Exchange credentials only when absolutely necessary. When exchanging them in-person isn’t possible, employees should prefer the phone instead of email, and only if they personally recognize the person they are talking to. - Change their passwords every two months. Remembering a large number of passwords can be daunting. We will purchase the services of a password management tool which generates and stores passwords. Employees are obliged to create a secure password for the tool itself, following the abovementioned advice. ### **Transfer data securely** Transferring data introduces security risk. Employees must: - Avoid transferring sensitive data (e.g. customer information, employee records) to other devices or accounts unless absolutely necessary. When mass transfer of such data is needed, we request employees to ask our \[_Security Specialists_\] for help. - Share confidential data over the company network/ system and not over public Wi-Fi or private connection. - Ensure that the recipients of the data are properly authorized people or organizations and have adequate security policies. - Report scams, privacy breaches and hacking attempts Our \[_IT Specialists/ Network Engineers_\] need to know about scams, breaches and malware so they can better protect our infrastructure. For this reason, we advise our employees to report perceived attacks, suspicious emails or phishing attempts as soon as possible to our specialists. Our \[_IT Specialists/ Network Engineers_\] must investigate promptly, resolve the issue and send a companywide alert when necessary. Our Security Specialists are responsible for advising employees on how to detect scam emails. We encourage our employees to reach out to them with any questions or concerns. ### **Additional measures** To reduce the likelihood of security breaches, we also instruct our employees to: - Turn off their screens and lock their devices when leaving their desks. - Report stolen or damaged equipment as soon as possible to \[_HR/ IT Department_\]. - Change all account passwords at once when a device is stolen. - Report a perceived threat or possible security weakness in company systems. - Refrain from downloading suspicious, unauthorized or illegal software on their company equipment. - Avoid accessing suspicious websites. We also expect our employees to comply with our [social media](https://resources.workable.com/social-media-company-policy) and [internet usage policy](https://resources.workable.com/internet-usage-policy). Our \[_Security Specialists/ Network Administrators_\] should: - Install firewalls, anti malware software and access authentication systems. - Arrange for security training to all employees. - Inform employees regularly about new scam emails or viruses and ways to combat them. - Investigate security breaches thoroughly. - Follow this policies provisions as other employees do. Our company will have all physical and digital shields to protect information. ### **Remote employees** [Remote employees](https://resources.workable.com/remote-work-policy) must follow this policy’s instructions too. Since they will be accessing our company’s accounts and systems from a distance, they are obliged to follow all data encryption, protection standards and settings, and ensure their private network is secure. We encourage them to seek advice from our \[_Security Specialists/ IT Administrators._\] ## **Disciplinary Action** We expect all our employees to always follow this policy and those who cause security breaches may face disciplinary action: - First-time, unintentional, small-scale security breach: We may issue a verbal warning and train the employee on security. - Intentional, repeated or large scale breaches (which cause severe financial or other damage): We will invoke more severe disciplinary action up to and including termination. We will examine each incident on a case-by-case basis. Additionally, employees who are observed to disregard our security instructions will face [progressive discipline](https://resources.workable.com/progressive-discipline-policy), even if their behavior hasn’t resulted in a security breach. ### **Take security seriously** Everyone, from our customers and partners to our employees and contractors, should feel that their data is safe. The only way to gain their trust is to proactively protect our systems and databases. We can all contribute to this by being vigilant and keeping cyber security top of mind."""
Internet Usage Policy,https://resources.workable.com/internet-usage-policy,"""## **Policy brief & purpose** Our employee internet usage policy outlines our guidelines for using our company’s internet connection, network and equipment. We want to avoid inappropriate or illegal internet use that creates risks for our company’s legality and reputation. ## **Scope** This employee internet usage policy applies to all our employees, contractors, volunteers and partners who access our network and computers. ## **Employee internet usage policy elements** ### **What is appropriate employee internet usage?** Our employees are advised to use our company’s internet connection for the following reasons: - To complete their job duties. - To seek out information that they can use to improve their work. - To access their social media accounts, while conforming to our [social media policy](https://resources.workable.com/social-media-company-policy). We don’t want to restrict our employees’ access to websites of their choice, but we expect our employees to exercise good judgement and remain productive at work while using the internet. Any use of our network and connection must follow our [confidentiality](https://resources.workable.com/confidentiality-company-policy) and [data protection policy](http://resources.workable.com/data-protection-company-policy). Employees should: - Keep their passwords secret at all times. - Log into their corporate accounts only from safe devices. - Use strong passwords to log into work-related websites and services. ### **What is inappropriate employee internet usage?** Our employees mustn’t use our network to: - Download or upload obscene, offensive or illegal material. - Send confidential information to unauthorized recipients. - Invade another person’s privacy and sensitive information. - Download or upload movies, music and other copyrighted material and software. - Visit potentially dangerous websites that can compromise the safety of our network and computers. - Perform unauthorized or illegal actions, like hacking, fraud, buying/selling illegal goods and more. We also advise our employees to be careful when downloading and opening/executing files and software. If they’re unsure if a file is safe, they should ask \[_their supervisor/ IT manager/ etc._\] Our company may install anti-virus and disk encryption software on our company computers. Employees may not deactivate or configure settings and firewalls without managerial approval. We won’t assume any responsibility if employee devices are infected by malicious software, or if their personal data are compromised as a result of inappropriate employee use. ### **Company-issued equipment** We expect our employees to respect and protect our company’s equipment. “Company equipment” in this computer usage policy for employees includes company-issued phones, laptops, tablets and any other electronic equipment, and belongs to our company. We advise our employees to lock their devices in their desks when they’re not using them. Our employees are responsible for their equipment whenever they take it out of their offices. ### **Email** Our employees can use their [corporate email accounts](https://resources.workable.com/email-usage-policy-template) for both work-related and personal purposes as long as they don’t violate this policy’s rules. Employees shouldn’t use their corporate email to: - Register to illegal, unsafe, disreputable or suspect websites and services. - Send obscene, offensive or discriminatory messages and content. - Send unauthorized advertisements or solicitation emails. - Sign up for a competitor’s services unless authorized. Our company has the right to monitor corporate emails. We also have the right to monitor websites employees visit on our computers. ## **Disciplinary Action** Employees who don’t conform to this employee internet usage policy will face disciplinary action. Serious violations will be cause for termination of employment, or legal action when appropriate. Examples of serious violations are: - Using our internet connection to steal or engage in other illegal activities. - Causing our computers to be infected by viruses, worms or other malicious software. - Sending offensive or inappropriate emails to our customers, colleagues or partners."""
Cell Phone Company Policy,https://resources.workable.com/cell-phone-company-policy,"""## **Policy brief & purpose** Our **employee cell phone policy** outlines our guidelines for using cell phones at work. We recognize that cell phones (and smartphones especially) have become an integral part of everyday life. They may be a great asset if used correctly (for productivity apps, calendars, business calls etc.) But, cell phones may also cause problems when used imprudently or excessively. ## **Scope** This policy applies to all our employees. ## **Policy elements** Despite their benefits, personal cell phones may cause problems in the workplace. Employees who use their cell phones excessively may: - Get [distracted from their work](https://resources.workable.com/social-media-company-policy). - Disturb colleagues by speaking on their phones. - Cause security issues from inappropriate use of company-issued equipment or [misuse of our company’s internet connection](http://resources.workable.com/internet-usage-policy). - Cause accidents when they illegally use their phones inside company vehicles or near areas where using phones is prohibited. Our company expects employees to use their cellphones prudently during working hours. **We advise our employees to:** - Use company-issued phones for business purposes only and preserve them in perfect condition. - Surf the internet, text and talk on the phone only for a few minutes per day. - Turn off or silence their phones when asked. **We won’t allow employees to:** - Play games on the cell phone during working hours. - Use their phones for any reason while driving a company vehicle. - Use their cell phone’s camera or microphone to record confidential information. - Use their phones in areas where cell use is explicitly prohibited (e.g. laboratories.) - Speak on their phones within earshot of colleagues’ working space during working hours. - Download or upload inappropriate, illegal or obscene material on a company cell phone using a corporate internet connection. ### **How to properly use cell phones in the workplace** Employees can benefit from using cell phones. They’re allowed to use their phones: - To make business calls. - To use productivity apps. - To check important messages. - To make brief personal calls away from the working space of colleagues. Employees can use their phones during [breaks](https://resources.workable.com/employee-breaks-policy-template) or at lunch hour and while on a stationary vehicle. ## **Disciplinary Consequences** Our company retains the right to monitor employees for excessive or inappropriate use of their cell phones. If an employee’s phone usage causes a decline in productivity or interferes with our operations, we’ll ban that employee from using their cell phones. Employees may face severe disciplinary action up to and including [termination](https://resources.workable.com/separation-of-employment-company-policy), in cases when they: - Cause a security breach. - Violate our [confidentiality policy](https://resources.workable.com/confidentiality-company-policy). - Cause an accident by recklessly using their phones."""
Email Usage Policy,https://resources.workable.com/email-usage-policy-template,"""## **Policy brief & purpose** Our corporate email usage policy helps employees use their company email addresses appropriately. Email is essential to our everyday jobs. We want to ensure that our employees understand the limitations of using their corporate email accounts. Our goal is to protect our confidential data from breaches and safeguard our reputation and technological property. ## **Scope** This policy applies to all employees, vendors and partners who are assigned (or given access to) a corporate email. This email may be assigned to an individual (e.g. employeename@companydomain) or department (e.g. <hr@companydomain.com>.) ## **Policy elements** Corporate emails are powerful tools that help employees in their jobs. Employees should use their company email primarily for work-related purposes. However, we want to provide employees with some freedom to use their emails for personal reasons. We will define what constitutes appropriate and inappropriate use. ### **Inappropriate use of company email** Our employees represent our company whenever they use their corporate email address. They must not: - Sign up for illegal, unreliable, disreputable or suspect websites and services. - Send unauthorized marketing content or solicitation emails. - Register for a competitor’s services unless authorized. - Send insulting or discriminatory messages and content. - Intentionally spam other people’s emails, including their coworkers. Our company has the right to monitor and archive corporate emails. ### **Appropriate use of corporate email** Employees are allowed to use their corporate email for work-related purposes without limitations. For example, employees can use their email to: - Communicate with current or prospective customers and partners. - Log in to purchased software they have legitimate access to. - Give their email address to people they meet at conferences, career fairs or other corporate events for business purposes. - Sign up for newsletters, platforms and other online services that will help them with their jobs or professional growth. ### **Personal use** Employees are allowed to use their corporate email for some personal reasons. For example, employees can use their corporate email to: - Register for classes or meetups. - Send emails to friends and family as long as they don’t spam or disclose confidential information. - Download ebooks, guides and other content for their personal use as long as it is safe and appropriate. Employees must adhere to this policy at all times, in addition to our [confidentiality](https://resources.workable.com/confidentiality-company-policy) and [data protection](https://resources.workable.com/data-protection-company-policy) guidelines. ### **Email security** Email is often the medium of hacker attacks, confidentiality breaches, viruses and other malware. These issues can compromise our reputation, legality and security of our equipment. Employees must: - Select strong passwords with at least eight characters (capital and lower-case letters, symbols and numbers) without using personal information (e.g. birthdays.) - Remember passwords instead of writing them down and keep them secret. - Change their email password every two months. Also, employees should always be vigilant to catch emails that carry malware or phishing attempts. We instruct employees to: - Avoid opening attachments and clicking on links when content is not adequately explained (e.g. “Watch this video, it’s amazing.”) - Be suspicious of clickbait titles. - Check email and names of unknown senders to ensure they are legitimate. - Look for inconsistencies or style red flags (e.g. grammar mistakes, capital letters, excessive number of exclamation marks.) If an employee isn’t sure that an email they received is safe, they can ask our \[_Security Specialists_.\] We remind our employees to keep their anti-malware programs updated. ### **Email signature** We encourage employees to create an email signature that exudes professionalism and represents our company well. Salespeople and executives, who represent our company to customers and stakeholders, should pay special attention to how they close emails. Here’s a template of an acceptable email signature: _\[Employee Name\]_ _\[Employee Title\], \[Company Name with link\]_ _\[Phone number\] | \[Company Address\]_ Employees may also include professional images, company logos and work-related videos and links in email signatures. If they are unsure how to do so, they can ask for help from our Office Manager or their supervisor. ## **Disciplinary action** Employees who don’t adhere to the present policy will face disciplinary action up to and including termination. Example reasons for termination are: - Using a corporate email address to send confidential data without authorization. - Sending offensive or inappropriate emails to our customers, colleagues or partners. - Using a corporate email for an illegal activity."""
Social Media Company Policy,https://resources.workable.com/social-media-company-policy,"""## **What is a corporate social media policy?** Most of your employees are likely to use one or more social platforms. Whatever they post on their personal accounts can be a potential risk for your company (e.g. if they share sensitive information). And, more importantly, using social media at work can affect productivity and focus. This is one of the reasons you need a company social media policy – to address limitations on what employees can post and to potentially place restrictions on social media use inside the workplace. The other reason is your own social media profile; as an organization, you’ll want to have a consistent voice on your social media and want to avoid posting potentially risky statements or information. A social media policy for employees can give them the instructions they need to know how to handle corporate accounts. **How restrictive should my company social media policy be?** Your employees own their social media profiles, so what they post there can’t be restricted by your organization. You can, however, provide them with reasonable guidelines about what they shouldn’t post about (e.g. confidential data) and provide any potential disciplinary actions if their posts affect your company’s image (e.g. hate speech). As far as your own company’s social media accounts are concerned, you’re entitled to set the rules of posting. ## **How do I distribute it?** Your social media policy should be part of your [employee handbook](https://resources.workable.com/employee-handbook-policies) or live inside your policy database (e.g. in your HRIS). Make sure all employees have read it, especially those in your social media team. Of course, remember that this policy is a living document – this is because the social media landscape changes often, new rules and regulations about privacy are introduced and trends can also play a part (e.g. the #metoo movement). Make sure you keep up-to-date with changes and think about whether your company social media policy might need some revamping. Here’s a simple social media policy template to get you started with the essentials: ## **Policy brief & purpose** Our **social media company policy** provides a framework for using social media. Social media is a place where people exchange information, opinions and experiences to learn, develop and have fun. Whether you’re handling a corporate account or using one of your own, you should remain productive and avoid damaging our organization in any way. This policy provides practical advice to avoid issues that might arise by careless use of social media in the workplace. ## **Scope** We expect all our employees to follow this policy. Also, by “social media”, we refer to a variety of online communities like blogs, social networks, chat rooms and forums – not just platforms like Facebook or Twitter. This policy is built around two different elements: one, using personal social media at work and two, representing our company through social media. ## **Policy elements** ### **Using personal social media** We _\[allow\]_ our employees to access their personal accounts at work. But, we expect you to act responsibly and ensure your productivity isn't affected. Whether you’re using your accounts for business or personal purposes, you may easily get sidetracked by the vast amount of available content. So, please restrict your use to a few minutes per work day. We ask you to be careful when posting on social media, too. We can’t restrict what you post there, but we expect you to adhere to our confidentiality policies at all times. We also caution you to avoid violating our anti-harassment policies or posting something that might make your collaboration with your colleagues more difficult (e.g. hate speech against groups where colleagues belong to). In general, please: #### **We advise our employees to:** - **Ensure others know that your personal account or statements don’t represent our company.** You shouldn’t state or imply that your personal opinions and content are authorized or endorsed by our company. We advise using a disclaimer such as “opinions are my own” to avoid misunderstandings. - **Avoid sharing intellectual property** like trademarks on a personal account without approval. Confidentiality policies and laws always apply. - **Avoid any defamatory, offensive or derogatory content.** It may be considered as a violation of our company’s anti-harassment policy, if directed towards colleagues, clients or partners. ### **Representing our company** Some employees represent our company by handling corporate social media accounts or speak on our company’s behalf. When you’re sitting behind a corporate social media account, we expect you to act carefully and responsibly to protect our company’s image and reputation. You should: - **Be respectful, polite and patient,** when engaging in conversations on our company's behalf. You should be extra careful when making declarations or promises towards customers and stakeholders. - **Avoid speaking on matters outside your field of expertise** when possible. Everyone should be careful not to answer questions or make statements that fall under somebody else’s responsibility. - **Follow our** [**confidentiality policy**](https://resources.workable.com/confidentiality-company-policy) **and** [**data protection policy**](https://resources.workable.com/data-protection-company-policy) and observe laws on copyright, trademarks, plagiarism and fair use. - **Inform our \[_PR/Marketing department_\]** when you're about to share any major-impact content. - **Avoid deleting or ignoring comments** for no reason. They should listen and reply to criticism. - **Never post discriminatory, offensive or libelous** content and commentary. - **Correct or remove** any misleading or false content as quickly as possible. ## **Disciplinary Consequences** We'll monitor all social media postings on our corporate account. We may have to take disciplinary action leading up to and including termination if employees do not follow this policy's guidelines. Examples of non-conformity with the employee social media policy include but are not limited to: - Disregarding job responsibilities and deadlines to use social media at work. - Disclosing confidential information through personal or corporate accounts. - Directing offensive comments towards other members of the online community. If you violate this policy inadvertently, you may receive a reprimand. We expect you to comply after that, or stricter [disciplinary actions](https://resources.workable.com/progressive-discipline-policy) will apply."""
Conflict Of Interest Company Policy,https://resources.workable.com/conflict-of-interest-company-policy,"""## **Policy brief & purpose** Our company **Conflict of Interest Policy** refers to any case where an employee’s personal interest might contradict the interest of the company they work for. This is an unwanted circumstance as it may have heavy implications on the employee’s judgement and commitment to the company, and by extension to the realization of its goals. This policy will outline the rules regarding conflict of interest and the responsibilities of employees and the company in resolving any such discrepancies. ## **Scope** This company conflict of interest policy applies to all prospective or current employees of the company, as well as independent contractors and persons acting on behalf of the company. ## **Policy elements** The relationship of the company with its employees should be based on mutual trust. As the company is committed to preserve the interests of people under its employment, it expects them to act only towards its own fundamental interests. Conflict of interest may occur whenever an employee’s interest in a particular subject may lead them to actions, activities or relationships that undermine the company and may place it to disadvantage. ### **What is an employee conflict of interest?** This situation may take many different forms that include, but are not limited to, conflict of interest examples: - Employees’ ability to use their position with the company to their personal advantage - Employees engaging in activities that will bring direct or indirect profit to a competitor - Employees owning shares of a competitor’s stock - Employees using connections obtained through the company for their own private purposes - Employees using company equipment or means to support an external business - Employees acting in ways that may compromise the company’s legality (e.g. taking bribes or bribing representatives of legal authorities) The possibility that a conflict of interest may occur can be addressed and resolved before any actual damage is done. Therefore, when an employee understands or suspects that a conflict of interest exists, they should bring this matter to the attention of management so corrective actions may be taken. Supervisors must also keep an eye on potential conflict of interests of their subordinates. The responsibility of resolving a conflict of interest starts from the immediate supervisor and may reach senior management. All conflicts of interest will be resolved as fairly as possible. Senior management has the responsibility of the final decision when a solution can not be found. In general, employees are advised to refrain from letting personal and/or financial interests and external activities come into opposition with the company’s fundamental interests. Note: _The same principles apply to the company in regards to its clients. When applicable, we are committed to not offer services or form partnerships with companies who are in direct competition with one of our existing clients._ ## **Disciplinary Consequences** In cases when a conflict of interest is deliberately concealed or when a solution can not be found, disciplinary action may be invoked up to and including termination."""
Fraternization Policy,https://resources.workable.com/fraternization-policy,"""## **Policy brief & purpose** Our Fraternization policy outlines our guidelines on employees forming personal relationships with each other. We don’t want to place undue restrictions on employees dating colleagues, as we acknowledge that freedom of choosing one’s partner is an individual’s right. But, without rules and guidelines, romantic relationships between colleagues may negatively impact our workplace. This policy will set restrictions to maintain workplace conduct and order. Friendships forming between employees are also included in this policy. Friendships allow for a more collaborative environment, but they might also occasionally create cliques and fragmentation inside departments. This policy does not restrict participating in labor unions or other labor or civil rights organizations. ## **Scope** This policy applies to all our employees regardless of gender or sexual orientation. For the purposes of this policy, “dating” includes consensual romantic relationships and sexual relations. Non-consensual relationships constitute [sexual harassment](https://resources.workable.com/workplace-harassment-company-policy) and we prohibit them explicitly. ## **Policy elements** ### **Dating in the workplace** Dating colleagues may cause problems if not handled correctly. Examples of common concerns are: - Colleagues who date might spend a large portion of their work time talking or meeting with each other instead of completing their duties. - Fights or breakups between couples might affect their ability to collaborate or maintain peace in the workplace. - Employees who dated supervisors might sue for sexual harassment if they are terminated. - Employees who date executives might unfairly benefit from favoritism. So, we advise our employees to: - Consider any possible [conflict of interest](https://resources.workable.com/conflict-of-interest-company-policy) before they enter into a relationship with a coworker. - Inform HR when they enter into a romantic or intimate relationship with a colleague. - Keep discussions of personal issues out of the workplace. - Seek counseling from HR or specialized employees (e.g. psychologist) if needed. - Maintain professionalism despite the status of the relationship and seek advice from their managers or HR to solve any issues. When serious problems arise between couples, they can arrange a meeting with HR or their manager to find a solution. Example of a possible solution is to consult with and transfer an employee to a different division, without loss of benefits or compensation. #### **Unacceptable and acceptable behavior** When two employees are in a relationship with one another, they should behave appropriately in the workplace. We define unacceptable behavior as any action that: - Offends our people. - Disrupts or hinders our operations. - Distracts our employees from their duties. - Decreases our employees’ individual performance. Examples of acceptable behavior for employees are: - Passing by their partner’s office to talk to them for non-work reasons for a short time. - Displaying affection discreetly and infrequently while on company premises. - Discussing their plans as a couple during breaks or lunch hours (with or without colleagues.) - Coming to and leaving from work together. Examples of unacceptable behavior for employees are: - Arguing in the workplace during or after working hours. - Kissing or touching inappropriately in front of colleagues. - Exchanging an excessive number of instant messages or calls unrelated to their work during working hours. - Making their colleagues uncomfortable by talking or boasting about the relationship during working hours. Employees who exhibit unacceptable behavior will face progressive discipline, up to and including termination in cases of repeated violations. HR is responsible for determining appropriate penalties. Employees are also obliged to behave appropriately towards their colleagues who date each other. We prohibit [victimization](https://resources.workable.com/no-retaliation-company-policy) and [hostility](https://resources.workable.com/workplace-violence-company-policy) towards employees for any reason. This includes sexual jokes, gossip and improper comments. Employees who witness this kind of behavior should report it to HR. Employees are obliged to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://resources.workable.com/employee-code-of-conduct-company-policy) at all times. #### **Dating managers** To avoid accusations of favoritism, abuse of authority and sexual harassment, we prohibit supervisors from dating employees who report to them. This restriction may extend to every manager within two levels above an employee, regardless of team or department to facilitate moving or promoting employees. Supervisors are strictly forbidden from dating their direct reports. If this occurs, the supervisor may face disciplinary action up to and including termination. This rule may be less strict in cases when managers enter into a consenting relationship with an employee from another team or department. When this happens, they must inform HR as soon as possible. It’s to their best interest not to conceal their relationship as they may provoke disciplinary action if and when they are discovered. HR will evaluate the situation and act accordingly (e.g. transfer an employee or prepare a [“love contract”](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/pages/2tyler-love%20contracts.aspx) to ensure the relationship is consensual.) Employees will not face demotion, victimization or loss of benefits if we have to transfer them to another team or department. The supervisor may be reprimanded depending on the circumstances. We may terminate those who repeatedly disregard this restriction. #### **Couples who are married or in a domestic partnership** Employees who enter in an official relationship with another employee after they’re both hired by our company should follow the rules outlined above. A married employee (or an employee who has a domestic partner) who serves as hiring manager for their team is not allowed to consider hiring their partner for open roles. This might bring about questions of favoritism in the hiring process. They are allowed to refer their partner for employment to other teams or departments for which they don’t have any managerial or hiring authority. If we discover that a hiring manager hired their partner, HR may move one of them to another team or branch where one won’t supervise the other. The hiring manager will receive a reprimand, as their hiring decision may have compromised our company’s commitment to [equal opportunity](https://resources.workable.com/equal-opportunity-company-policy) and avoiding favoritism. ### **Friendships in the workplace** Employees who work together may naturally form friendships either in or out of their workplace. We encourage this relationship between peers, as it can help employees communicate, collaborate and preserve harmony while working. However, we must consider the negative consequences of forming this kind of personal relationship. Employees who are friends might occasionally: - Enter into disputes over borrowed money. - Gossip about colleagues and acquaintances. - Form cliques that exclude certain colleagues and bring discord. - Prevent one another (whether directly or indirectly) from accepting promotions or relocations for the sake of their friendship. To mitigate possible issues, we advise our employees to: - Discuss non-work related issues outside of the workplace. - Ask for their managers or HR’s help when they are unable to resolve an issue or conflict of interest. - Follow our Code of Conduct and act professionally at all times. - Focus on their work instead of their friendships while at the office. #### **Friendships with supervisors** Being friends with one’s manager may have both positive and negative consequences. On one hand, friendship might facilitate honesty, trust and job satisfaction for both parties. But, friendship might also make managers and employees confused about how they should treat each other. Questions of favoritism might arise too, and result in negative feelings and loss of morale. For these reasons, we discourage employees being friends with their managers. We do encourage a harmonious and open relationship, but we think it’s to everyone’s best interest if managers are not involved with their direct reports outside of the workplace. ### **Openness** The key point of this policy is openness. We can’t stop employees from forming relationships with one another and trying to prohibit them from doing so could incite deceit, resentment and gossip. For this reason, we expect our employees to be open about their personal relationships with colleagues. This does not mean that employees should draw attention to their relationship. But, keeping work relationships secret may negatively impact all parties involved. HR will be at our employees’ disposal to explain our policy, attitude and course of action in cases of violation. ### **Our company’s commitment** Just like we expect employees to comply with this policy, our company has responsibilities that we are obliged to follow. We will: - Enforce this policy to HR and senior management as well as employees. - Treat everyone equally when taking disciplinary action without discriminating against protected characteristics. - Prohibit victimization, [violence](https://resources.workable.com/workplace-violence-company-policy) and [retaliation](https://resources.workable.com/no-retaliation-company-policy) of any kind. - Examine each situation separately and consider all aspects and perspectives before making decisions. Our employees should follow our [anti-discrimination policy](https://resources.workable.com/equal-opportunity-company-policy) at all times. For example, HR must not penalize a homosexual couple differently than a heterosexual couple when they both have violated the present policy in the same manner. Likewise, if a team member is discovered to have a relationship with their manager, the person who will be transferred or terminated must not be chosen based on their gender. We will keep our employees’ freedom and individual rights in mind and follow the law."""
Employment Of Relatives Company Policy,https://resources.workable.com/employment-of-relatives-company-policy,"""## **Policy brief & purpose** Our sample **employment of relatives policy** demonstrates our attitude towards nepotism and employing people who are related either by blood or marriage. We won't reject a suitable job candidate on grounds of their relation to a current employee. However, we recognize that encouraging the employment of relatives may have a negative impact on productivity and fuel accusations of nepotism and favoritism. This policy aims to minimize these risks. ## **Scope** This policy applies to all employees regardless of status, position or department. ## **Policy elements** We use the term “relatives” to refer to any person who has a relation by blood or marriage within the third degree with our employee. We also include people who live together in a domestic partnership or children who were adopted. This includes: parents, step-parents, grandparents, in-laws, spouses or domestic partners, children, step-children, adoptive children, grandchildren, siblings, uncles, aunts, nieces and nephews. We aim to keep our hiring process free of discrimination. We may hire a person who is related to one of our current employees if we consider that person the best fit for a position. We may also accept referrals from employees. ### **What is nepotism in the workplace?** Favoritism or conflict of interest may occur when manager are involved in a process with their relatives. Examples are when: - Managers decide which team member to promote. - Managers decide which contracts to renew. - Managers complete performance reviews. - Managers [discipline](https://resources.workable.com/progressive-discipline-policy) their relative. - Managers are part of a hiring committee. To avoid such incidents or suspicions of favoritism and conflict of interest, we established anti-nepotism policies: - Employees who are related must not be involved in a supervisory/reporting relationship with one another. - Employees can not be transferred, promoted or hired inside a reporting relationship with a relative. - Employees can not be part of a hiring committee, when a relative is considered for the position. Please report any relationship with a relative to HR, if you find yourself in a reporting relationship with that relative or in a hiring committee that considers that relative for employment. If you don't, you may face disciplinary action. If two employees who are in a reporting relationship become relatives in the course of their employment, one of the two must be transferred. We may give our employees time to discuss and choose which of them will be transferred, before management makes a final decision. Transfers will be discrimination-free. For example, the person being transferred must not always be a woman. This will violate our anti-discrimination policy. We ask you to act professionally when working with a relative and seek counsel from your manager or HR if there are any problems. ## **Disciplinary Consequences** If a previously unreported relative relationship is discovered between a manager and a team member one of them will be transferred. If incidents of favoritism or conflict of interest have occurred, both employees will be subjected to disciplinary actions that range from reprimand to [termination for cause](https://resources.workable.com/separation-of-employment-company-policy)."""

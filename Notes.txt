Need employee id (database) and employeeId (hr employee id) to be separate;
	Sample hr employee ids: 'E02002', 'E02003', 'E02004', 'E02005'
	How to hide database id from client?
	How to get the LLM Agents creating employees to create employees with the correct next hr employee id? Perhaps a service that returns next employee id: 'E02***'. 
		Perhaps update the saveEmployee @Tool description attribute to mention the next employee id @Tool

Run terminal commands before running server:
	Brave Search: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers-archived/tree/main/src/brave-search
		npm i @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search	
		export BRAVE_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY>
		Configuration: src/main/resources/mcp-servers.json
	Elastic Search: https://github.com/elastic/mcp-server-elasticsearch
		npm i @elastic/mcp-server-elasticsearch
		Use the following data to load an Elastic Index: mcp-human-resources/employee_data_load.csv
		Configuration: src/main/resources/mcp-servers.json
			Note that a space was needed in "ES_API_KEY": " ", since local Elastic Index has not security enabled
	If using GROQ as your LLM - https://console.groq.com/keys
		export GROQ_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY>	
	If using Google Gemini, follow the folowing directions.
		https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/chat/vertexai-gemini-chat.html	
		Including the following command run in the terminal that also starts the spring-boot app.
			gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID> && gcloud auth application-default login <ACCOUNT>
		Need to set up ADC. (Need to run on a machine with a browser)
			Helped with seting up ADC locally: 
				https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment
				https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEsC0BpEYGM
			gcloud auth application-default login
			In the browser when prompted choose my google user and then selected all access options.
			Terminal then showed: Credentials saved to file: [/home/davidbrown/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json]
			First test resulted in an error and instructions with url link to resolve. I needed to follow the link and enable Vertex AI API

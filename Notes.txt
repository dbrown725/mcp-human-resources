Need employee id (database) and employeeId (hr employee id) to be separate;
	Sample hr employee ids: 'E02002', 'E02003', 'E02004', 'E02005'
	How to hide database id from client?
	How to get the LLM Agents creating employees to create employees with the correct next hr employee id? Perhaps a service that returns next employee id: 'E02***'. 
		Perhaps update the saveEmployee @Tool description attribute to mention the next employee id @Tool

	Look into Spring AI, ElasticSearch RAG: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms2xRO8B1YU
